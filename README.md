## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/projectakshith/ratio-d
cd ratio-d
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Python FastAPI)

The backend handles the data fetching and session management logic.

```bash
cd backend
# create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# start the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (Next.js)

The frontend is a PWA built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

```bash
# from the root ratio-d directory
npm install

# start the development server
npm run dev
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root `ratio-d` directory:

```bash
# Frontend: comma-separated URLs for your backend instances
BACKEND_URLS="http://localhost:8000"

# Security: must be identical on both frontend and backend
INTERNAL_SECRET="your_secure_random_string"
```

> [!TIP]
> The `INTERNAL_SECRET` is used for a server-to-server handshake between Next.js and FastAPI. It ensures that only your frontend can communicate with your backend.
